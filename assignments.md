## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of a total of four gobbets (two each semester), two long essays (one each semester), two presentations (one each semester). In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and prepared to discuss them. Most weeks students will also be asked to do short unassessed presentations 10 or less minutes each.

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work or on a cover page, please include:

* The date of submission
* Your student number
* The **category** of assessment you are submitting (e.g. Gobbet, Long Essay, etc.)
* A **specific title** describing the contents 
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif font (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html)

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully. 

In your bibliography, please have separate sections for your secondary sources and the primary sources you used.

If you prefer **and do so consistently**, you may use the Chicago Style (Notes and Bibliography) over the St Andrews note formatting. I encourage you to manage your sources in a referencing tool such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) which makes it easy to automatically generate formatted notes and bibliography if you have the correct information for each source.

### Primary Source Essay

In each of the two semesters students will be asked to submit a short 800 word analytical essay that analyses a primary source. 

* Selecting a source: The student may select a source related to their long essay research, from the primary sources assigned during the semester, but from beyond the assigned portion (a different page range, another part, another volume etc.), or with approval of the tutor, a source of interest to the student. The source may be visual (a map, photograph, drawing, etc.) or textual. The full body of the source must be included at the top of the essay, preceded by a citation. You may not choose one of the sources we have consulted in class.

* Writing the primary source essay: Your goal in the essay is to draw out the revealing features of a source and demonstrate your abilities for analysis. A good primary source essay will:
    * it will identify the source and context (including its language, whether the text provided is a translation, and the place where this document was done), its purpose and the main characters involved;
    * it will comment on the particular point or points raised in the extract (ask yourself, why was this extract set?);
    * it will explain any distinctive words or phrases or visual features
    * it will then, towards the end, comment more discursively on some of the broader issues involved. Is this a true or accurate narrative of events? Are the hopes of the protagonist ultimately realised? Where does this extract fit into the wider context of what we know from our sources?
    * Try to make about four to five points. Avoid an over-lengthy introduction; get to the point quickly, do not simply rephrase the wording of the source itself, and make sure that you analyse it.
    * For those of you also taking literature modules in other Schools, please note that history primary source essays and gobbets are less an exercise in textual criticism and much more an attempt to get to the heart of the issues contained within a document, and the issues concerning the nature of the document itself.

### Long Essay

The two long essays for the course are the highest value assessments for the module and should be 5,000 words long. There will, however, not be a length penalty on submitted essays up to 8,000 words if you wish to write something in even greater depth (thereafter the 10% rule applies). The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. The Long Essay should be primary source driven.

This module is a module on the history of cities but also a spatial history module. You may choose to write about some aspect a city, a part of a city, comparisons between cities, some aspect of life within a city, but also you are most welcome to write an essay which has a strongly spatial theme. In this module we study spaces from the scale of the domestic space of a home up to a regional scale. If there are other East or Southeast Asia essay topics that you would like to write about but you are worried may fall outside the scope of the module will usually be approved, just check with me first.

### Choosing a Long Essay Topic

Choosing an essay topic and then, having researched this topic, developing a focused argument can be challenging for students who have usually been given an "essay question" in all previous modules. I will provide a few examples of past student long essay titles that gives you some ideas of themes, and also a few first class essays that shows you the variety of kinds of essays that have been written for some of my modules in the past. 

I recommend that you make use of primary historical sources in your essay and develop an argument around them. As you will see, almost all of the first class sample essays are ones which took the challenge of working with primary historical material. Historiographical essays which focus on a particular historical debate about which you develop your own position may also be submitted instead, but such essays are difficult to develop with originality.

**What do I do when I can't think of a topic?** For all students that do not immediately think of a theme, time period, or event they want to focus on for their semester-long work on the long essay, **I strongly encourage** you to browse the primary source list at the end of this handbook and spend a day or two closely examining one or more relevant primary sources or source collections. What strikes you as interesting, curious, ironic, or problematic about these sources? That reaction is very often the beginning of an excellent essay. When you come across that feeling, then look for secondary scholarship on a related theme or the relevant event, person, or organisation that you were looking at, and see what kinds of arguments are already being made about it. Look at recently published articles in leading historical journals: what kinds of sources do they use? How do they build an argument around it?

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history explores change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an **analytical historical research essay** is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order **to make a historical argument about some problem, clearly defined**. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about a specific problem encompassing some aspect of that event: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, **should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact**. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is only one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, **avoid sentences** such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless such sentences are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. Otherwise, there is a danger that your essay will merely provide a summary of some quantity of information you have found, rather than present the results of your analysis of that research in a useful way. In other words, **do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you *have argued and shown* in the essay**. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, "In this essay, I will argue that..." followed by a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important.

For example, this is **not** an argument:

*In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the alarm clock sleep function and our productivity in modern life.*

This is an argument:

*I will argue that the alarm clock sleep function is a major hindrance to our productivity without contributing at all to our rest after a night of sleep. I will base this upon the studies of Hansen and Jenson in 1983 and in a series of interviews with wise old people in 2014. This argument is important because, as I will show, evidence shows that the increased availability of time in the morning to eat a healthier breakfast, carry out some light house chores, and do morning exercise, not only allows for greater evening rest after a long day of work, but decreases the tiredness we feel throughout the day.*

It presents the argument clearly in one sentence, gives a clear indication of how the argument will be carried out, and gives the reader some indication of why the argument matters, that is, why it constitutes an interesting scholarly contribution.

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to stay sharply focused on the argument you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

**Engaging with the historiography:** What does this phrase mean? It means directly and explicitly acknowledging what historians have said about your topic and/or your specific question in existing work and then putting your own findings into conversation with them.  Point out both positive contributions and problematic ones when appropriate. Who has worked on this before, and what specifically have they argued? See your essay as part of a larger conversation (it doesn't necessarily have to be an adversarial one) that includes previous historians. Introduce related scholarship early on in your essay, but also as you progress in your argument, noting points where you are reinforcing, tweaking, or contradicting previous scholarship. 

**Important Note on the Historiography: But what if no one or almost no one has written on exactly what I have written about? "The historiography" relevant to your essay *does not mean* only scholarship about the same event, country, or even time period: very often the most useful and rich historiography for you to engage with is found in the form of scholarship on a similar theme but in another place or time.** If you find yourself saying, "No one has written about my topic before," and you have found less than, say, a dozen or more potential secondary works to engage with (though you may not end up using them all), then you have failed to think about the historiography of your topic in sufficiently broad terms. Ask yourself, what broader category is my topic an instance of? Who has made interesting and important contributions on that broader category or theme in the scholarship of other events, places, times? If not only within the historical scholarship, what of other scholars in the humanities and social sciences? You should be able to find at least half a dozen, but ideally a dozen (or more) secondary sources (in addition to primary sources you focus on), with several of these being engaged with directly in the body of the text, not merely cited for evidence.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay? Does it move beyond telling the reader what the essay is "about", avoid the future tense and the helping verb "will", and tell the reader very clearly what *has been accomplished* in the essay and *what is demonstrated* in the essay
* Does the essay avoid introducing new findings or arguments in the conclusion?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible? Do I instead summarise, without plagiarising, and cite the work of secondary work except when the particular wording or language is key to the argument I wish to make?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate primary sources and secondary sources?
* Have I avoided ever using phrases like "many historians argue" or "much scholarship" or "it is often argued" and replaced all such instances with very specific examples and citations?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Have I gone back and considered my major claims from a critical perspective, and answered any major possible weaknesses in my essay?
* Is my argument non-trivial? That is, does it go beyond a well-known historical consensus about a topic?
* Has the long essay engaged with the historiography on the relevant issue effectively throughout and not merely the introduction?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear?
* Did I include page numbers?
* Did I divide primary and secondary sources into separate sections of my bibliography?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History or alternatively Chicago Style Notes and Bibliography consistently for all footnotes and bibliography?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the background for the argument does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a question or topic for your Long Essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of primary sources is encouraged but not required. An essay based on sources that are the results of a simple google search can be written in an evening of frantic last minute work, but rarely demonstrates much effort, research skill, or ability to isolate high-quality materials to support an argument. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process.

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. It will also often mean that you end up with several books or articles that are decades old and don't reflect more recent debates. You are also lulled into the confident state of mind that "I have enough material" only to discover after weeks of procrastination that only a fragment of your pile of promisingly titled works are relevant to your specific argument. Instead think of using a spiral motion: reading one recent survey, scrape the footnotes and bibliography for interesting related works (often not only related to the exact place, event, or period of your theme), and then move out (reading more broadly in the theme) and in (moving more deeply in the primary sources and close empirical literature) several times throughout the semester.

### How your Long Essay is Evaluated

The points that follow should be fairly clear from the questions posed above but are restated from the perspective of the marker of a very strong long essay:

- The essay gives a clear presentation of its argument in the introduction of the essay
- The essay is written well and has a clear structure.
- The argument is well signposted, with different sub-arguments of the essay clearly introduced with clear topical sentences.
- The essay shows that extensive reading and research was done in order to write this essay in the secondary and primary source literature.
- The School of History Style Guide was carefully followed.
- A well-formatted bibliography is provided showing that research was carried out using sources of an appropriate quality and number, including at least half a dozen secondary sources (more likely to be a dozen or more).
- The essay consistently cites its sources with footnotes
- This essay employs evidence based on its sources in an effective manner.
- Unless it is a historiographical essay, the essay works with primary sources which make a substantive contribution to its main argument.
- The essay engages with the relevant historiography on this topic directly and effectively throughout
- The essay has a good balance between empirical examples and presenting evidence on the one hand, and strong analysis contributing to the argument on the other
- The argument of the essay is not trivial, overly general, or merely represent a summary of the widely recognized academic consensus on a given topic

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. Paper copies do not need to be submitted: let's save paper. If you are concerned that any given assignment was not correctly submitted to the MMS, you are free to email a copy of your submitted assignment, if you like. In the event an assignment was not correctly uploaded to the MMS for some reason, but an emailed copy was sent in time, that date of submission will be used, but a copy will still need to be submitted to the MMS thereafter.

### Feedback

Feedback is generally provided directly on the mark sheet, which will be posted to the MMS within 10 work days (2 weeks). Presentations, however, are marked in bundles with feedback out by the end of week 5 and week 11. Depending on assignment, there may be additional feedback provided in the margins of the original essay. If that is the case, you will find two files uploaded with your mark.

### Assessed Presentations

Most weeks of the semester students will be given and opportunity to present a summary, critique, and raise some discussion questions based on supplementary readings. Two such presentations for each student will be given more time and assessed formally, at least one should be a reading presentation and at least one is a seminar lead presentation. Each of your presentations will be worth 5% of your overall mark for the module. You may volunteer to give more than one reading presentations (but must give the presentation if you commit to it). If you do two or three reading presentations (instead of two) your best presentation will have its mark recorded.

**Reading Presentation:** a reading presentation should be 15 minutes in length and not a minute longer. It may focus on a single author monograph listed in required, elective or the "Further Reading" section for the week and labelled with a (P). If we have been assigned only a portion of this reading, you should still make your presentation on the work as a whole. It should summarise the main arguments, and make 1-3 to focused critiques or observations about the read material. A supplementary handout (1-2 pages at most) should be uploaded to the MMS and also copies of it brought that includes some bullet points from the summary, any key persons or dates, and a few questions about the themes in the reading to kick off our discussion. You may optionally give a second or third reading presentation during the year.

**Seminar Lead Presentation:** In a seminar lead presentation you will lead the seminar discussion for 30-45 minutes. Focusing on the assigned readings, you may speak for 5-10m about some of the readings and their context, if you wish, and you may run the remainder of the time as you see most appropriate. This may include: asking questions and moderating the discussion that follows; carrying out specific tasks or games related to the readings; bringing in a supplemental primary source (perhaps one mentioned or related to those mentioned in one or more reading) and working with the class on reading it and analysing it; asking students to discuss questions in pairs or groups; and so on. You may also ask students to perform a task in preparation for the seminar, including interacting with the moodle, as you see fit. I may participate in some of the activity and discussion but also need to hang back a bit to observe and take notes for marking purposes. The purpose of this exercise is to give you a taste of the challenges of running a seminar, keeping students engaged, getting students to more actively participate, drawing out important points from the reading, and showing a good mastery of the material for the day.

**Important**: In addition to these assessed presentation, you will often be asked to make short non-assessed presentations, usually 5 minutes or less in length throughout the year on your elective readings. Your weekly handout will be a guide for me to ask you about the contents. 

Questions to ask yourself as you prepare your assessed presentations:

* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two pages accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* Did I upload the handout to the moodle before giving my presentation?
* If appropriate, did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map for the discussion?
* Did the handout include 1-3 discussion questions?
* Was the time limit strictly observed in the presentation?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a few key points?
* Did I have good eye contact with students when I presented?
* Was there a good balance of arguments and a few examples to support them?
* When I led the seminar did I help draw out important arguments and points from the reading for discussion?
* Did I ensure that all students were able to participate in discussion for seminar lead presentations?

## Blog Entries

We have a module website at:

[http://spatialhistory.net/cities/](http://spatialhistory.net/cities/)

This is a public facing website where students will contribute postings, but no students will be asked to use their real name. You can set or change your pseudonym through the blog interface whenever you like. Students are required to post a **minimum of eight postings** during the year, and these postings must be **posted across eight different weeks** and **at least four postings done in the first semester**. There is flexibility on the content: you may freely post on readings from before or after the week posted, and may have more than one posting related to material from a single week. The total number of words posted across the year must be a minimum of 3,000 words posted across a minimum of 6 entries from different weeks (more words or more postings during the year are welcome).  

At the end of the year, you should copy and paste six selected blog postings, including their titles, links to the online version, and the date they were posted online into a document and upload this document to the MMS. The postings must already be on the blog, and cannot be new postings produced for the submission. Points for the overall mark will be the average of the mark on the six selected and submitted postings. Each posting will not receive specific feedback but instead receive a mark based on the cumulative score according to the following simple criteria, which are judged to be *either present or absent* (no partial marks):

* 5 points if the posting makes a clear analytical point
* 4 points if the posting makes concrete references to particular parts of a reading, with a footnote
* 3 points if the posting was well-written in terms of language
* 3 points if the posting was relevant to assigned readings or further readings
* 3 points if the posting keeps a good focus throughout.
* 2 additional points will be given for postings that are of a high quality

A decent posting, with no significant flaws, should, therefore, get a score of 18. Particularly strong postings may garner 20s. *Example:* A student writes 10 postings during the semester totalling 7,000 words. They select 6 of these, including 2 high quality post of 600 words (20), 3 posts that meet the requirements, (500 words x 1, 700 words x 2, each getting 18), and 1 post of 900 words that follows all the above but did not maintain a clear focus (18-3=15), then the overall blog mark would come to (20+20+18+18+18+15)/6 = 18.2

**How to Post Blog Entries:** You will be given details for your login information late in the first week. Then to login, go to:

[http://spatialhistory.net/cities/post/](http://spatialhistory.net/cities/post/)

- Use your login user name and password. This will be given to you by the end of Week 1.
- From there, on the left hand sidey ou can choose "Add New" from the "Posts" menu.
- There, give your posting a title
- add a few tags on the right side without any caps, for example "japan, 20th century, domestic space, kitchens, advertising" that indicate things like place, time, people, topics that are relevant to your posting (all without caps).
- Write your blog posting in the middle
- When you have a quote or refer to a text, you must add a footnote by enclosing the footnote countents in double parenthesis. You must leave a space before the first and after the last parenthesis. Example: Here is some text. ((And here is the footnote contents with a space before it))
- Don't worry about adding categories.
- You can "preview" your posting if you want to read it over and look for mistakes with a nicer view.
- When you are happy with the posting, click "Publish" or save the draft if you wish to return to it later
- You can always return to postings by going to "Posts" on the left and "All Posts"

**What to Write:**

- Your postings should ideally each aim to be between 300-1,000 words but you won't be penalised for something longer on word count alone. 
- The posts should have a single overarching purpose and unified focus
- The posts should be primarily focused on material in the elective or further readings, and may only be from the required set readings if it is a primary source. It may refer to additional readings if they are part of your research for your long essay.
- Avoid vague references to what you like and don't like; what you found interesting or not interesting - unless you follow this up with concrete and specific reasons why something is interesting or valuable.
- Be concise and avoid repetition. 

Here are some ideas of what make good postings (but you aren't limited to this):

- Focus in on a passage in a primary source, quote part of the passage (try not to make the quote too long) in the posting and then offer a reflection on it. Blog posts are great places to practice your skills for the primary source essay.
- Same as above, but instead of just offering a reflection, put that passage into meaningful conversation with another secondary or primary reading we did either this week or another week.
- Describe or synthesise a point that you find important or interesting from a secondary reading and say why you think it is important.
- Put the arguments of two secondary sources into dialogue with each other
- Reflect on some of the theoretical readings we have done and how they might apply to a case study we have looked at.
- Reflect on how the arguments of a text might contribute to our understanding of some other clase in another place or time
- Write a posting on the use of language or terms in a source and why you think it is meaningful or important
- Write a posting around a certain pattern you see across multiple texts
