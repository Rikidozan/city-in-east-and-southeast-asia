## Assignments

The assessed portion of the coursework for this module consists of a total of four gobbets (two each semester), two long essays (one each semester), two presentations (one each semester). In addition, students are required to come prepared each week having completed the assigned reading and prepared to discuss them. Most weeks students will also be asked to do short unassessed presentations 10 or less minutes each.

### Gobbet Exercise

In both semesters students will be asked to submit two gobbets, or source analysis essays. Each of these may not exceed 1,000 words in length. Each gobbet collection assignment will be worth 10% of your total coursework mark. In addition, prior to the deadline for each, we will do a practice gobbet that is not assessed.

* Selecting a source: The student may select a source related to their long essay research, from the primary sources assigned during the semester, but from beyond the assigned portion (a different page range, another part, another volume etc.), or with approval of the tutor, a source of interest to the student. The source may be visual (a map, photograph, drawing, etc.) or textual but no more than one visual source per two gobbet assignment. If chosen from among assigned primary sources, they must come from different weeks. The full body of the source must be included at the top of the essay, and the source text must not exceed 500 words, preceded by a citation and, in the event the source is chosen by the student, a sentence or two on what precedes/follows the selected fragment (up to 100 words).

* Writing the gobbet: Your goal in the gobbet is to draw out the revealing features of a short source and demonstrate your abilities for analysis. A good gobbet will:
    *  it will identify the document and context (including its language, whether the text provided is a translation, and the place where this document was done), its purpose and the main characters involved;
    *  it will comment on the particular point or points raised in the extract (ask yourself, why was this extract set?);
    * it will explain any distinctive words or phrases
    * it will then, towards the end, comment more discursively on some of the broader issues involved. Is this a true or accurate narrative of events? Are the hopes of the protagonist ultimately realised? Where does this extract fit into the wider context of what we know from our sources?
    * Try to make about four to five points. Avoid an over-lengthy introduction; get to the point quickly, do not simply rephrase the wording of the gobbet, and make sure that you analyse it.
    * For those of you also taking literature modules in other Schools, please note that history gobbets are less an exercise in textual criticism and much more an attempt to get to the heart of the issues contained within a document, and the issues concerning the nature of the document itself.

### Long Essay

The two long essays for the course are each worth 25% of the coursework and should each be 5,000 words or less. The process of composing an essay of this length is made far easier if make steady progress throughout the semester rather than face potential panic and disappointment nearer the deadline. Narrow down an area of interest, read within this area of interest, isolate a few questions of interest, carry out further reading and analysis, and then proceed to write an essay which makes a convincing historical argument. The Long Essay should be primary source driven.

Some class time on week three will be dedicated to discussing the essay. At that time, please send me two or three general potential topics of interest that are related to cities in East and Southeast Asia, the name of one or two secondary or primary historical works related to each, and a brief note as to why you chose that work. I will give feedback on the ideas, and throughout the semester encourage students to visit me in office hours to help discuss the move from general topics of interest to specific historical questions. I am also willing to look at an outline of your essay and your final list of sources.

### Making an Argument

The academic study of history embraces change in the past as a way to explore solutions to particular problems. The object of an analytical historical research essay is not to tell us simply what happened, but to use what happened in order to make a historical argument about some problem clearly defined. For example, if an essay was written (to take an example from Chinese history) about some aspect of the Boxer Rebellion, it should not consider its task complete when the major facts of the Boxer Rebellion have been retold. That is closer to the genre of the encyclopaedia entry than of academic historical study. It should endeavour to use the Boxer Rebellion as an opportunity to tell us something, to make an argument about something: what does the rebellion reveal about the nature of Western imperialism? The rise of new religious movements in China? The weakness of the late Qing state? The rise of Japan? And so on. The possibilities are many, but in every case, they offer an answer to the question: So what? Why does this history matter? History can and should tell stories, but a research essay embeds a story within an arc of an argument - if it contains narrative elements, it must also always include an analytic element.

The historical argument in your long essays, in particular, should be clearly and unambiguously stated in the span of 1-3 sentences somewhere in the opening third of the essay, preferably in the opening paragraph or two. If you are answering one of the questions rather than choosing one of the broader topics, this can usually be accomplished by giving a clear answer and adding at least some detail about how you will go on to support your answer. Your argument should be falsifiable, that is, it should be possible to meaningfully contradict the argument you make and demonstrate that it is false if the presented evidence is not sufficient or poorly deployed. It should not be obvious, trivial, or a well-known and rarely contested fact. Challenging as false an existing historian's argument that has become considered obvious and rarely contested, however, is one ambitious way to find your way to an interesting and original argument but only if your evidence is sufficient. Alternatively, if you have found evidence that supports the existing arguments of historians in a given area of research in a new set of sources, from a fresh perspective, or in greater depth, or in a comparative light, that also often yields a strong argument. If you have identified a debate in the historiography and wish to take a position on it without simply repeating all of the points made by one of the participants of the debate, that can also yield an essay with a strong argument but you should take care to acknowledge the position and evidence of the other side.

**Presenting your Argument:** There are a number of different ways to write a strong essay and present the argument, but in this module, I would like to strongly encourage you to "front-load" your argument and do so clearly, that is, to present clearly early in the essay what it is you will argue and why it is important. For example, avoid sentences such as "I will explain..." or "I aim to understand..." or "I will explore..." unless these are immediately followed by the explanation, what you ended up understanding, or what the result of your exploration was. In other words, do not use the introduction to make predictions about what you will do, but tell the reader in very clear terms what you **have argued and shown** in the essay. There are many ways to do this in more or less subtle language but there is no harm in a very clear, "In this essay, I will argue that..." followed by a short overview of what kinds of evidence you will use, how your argument fits into a historiographical context (how your argument relates to what other historians have to say about the matter), and why you think it is important.

For example replace:

*In this essay, I will explore the relationship between the alarm clock sleep function and our productivity in modern life.*

with something like:

*I will argue that the alarm clock sleep function is a major hindrance to our productivity without contributing at all to our rest after a night of sleep. I will base this upon the studies of Hansen and Jenson in 1983 and in a series of interviews with wise old people in 2014. This argument is important because, as I will show, evidence shows that the increased availability of time in the morning to eat a healthier breakfast, carry out some light house chores, and do morning exercise, not only allows for greater evening rest after a long day of work, but decreases the tiredness we feel throughout the day.*

**Sticking to your Argument:** All of us come across many interesting stories, anecdotes, and sub-points that we want to share in writing our essays. However, it is important to stay sharply focused on the argument you are going to make in the essay. After you have finished writing your essay, read it through and for each paragraph and sentence ask yourself if it supported your argument, provided essential background to establishing your argument, or else if it does not offer much of a contribution. If it doesn't, cut it ruthlessly from your essay to make room for better material.

Some other questions to ask yourself as you write the long essay:

* Does the essay have a clear introduction which articulates the argument I wish to make in the essay?
* Does the essay have a clear conclusion which restates the main points and then makes some effort to contextualise the findings in the broader issues of the course?
* Does the essay situate the argument being made in the context of the sources used, and its relevance to the study of our module topic?
* Does the essay show a good understanding of the sources used, and use them effectively in supporting my argument with clear and specific examples to enforce my points?
* Does the essay avoid long quotations from secondary works whenever possible?
* Have I been careful not to plagiarise sources and cite them whenever used?
* Have I cited with footnotes all claims that are not a well-known and general historical fact.
* Have I used a variety of appropriate sources?
* Does the essay retain a strong focus on the main argument, and avoid passages which stray significantly from the main points?
* Does the essay avoid being a summary or introduction to a particular topic, event, or person in order to make a clear argument that is falsifiable?
* Does the essay consider alternative explanations, acknowledge inconvenient facts, and point out sources or historians who may have differing approaches?
* Did I proofread my essay, check the spelling, and reread for sentences that are unclear?
* Did I carefully follow the style guide for the School of History for all my footnotes?
* Did I include a bibliography at the end of my essay and is it formatted according to the School of History style guide?
* Have I avoided using websites and newspaper articles not by academic authors to support my claims when there are good academic historical scholarship (in monograph, journal article, or online published forms)
* Have I taken care that the background for the argument does not take up too much of the entire length of the essay (less than 25%, usually)
* Did I include a word count in the header and followed the other header guidelines?
* Did I follow the formatting guidelines below?

### Carrying Out Research for Essays

When you have selected a question or topic for your longer essay the first, most obvious place to look for information on the topic is among the various books and articles that are assigned or proposed in this course. Early on, it is useful to focus on skimming through sources as you find them, noting carefully works of potential interest found in the footnotes or bibliographies of these works to help you broaden and then later focus in your research. As you find works of interest, make note of the authors and look for other articles or books by the same author, then repeat the process, looking again through the footnotes and bibliography for sources more specifically related to the topic you are researching.

When you do not find enough through the above method of beginning your trail with our existing assigned works, proceed to search in various databases for relevant keywords:

* Our library catalogue
* Major journal databases we have access to such as JSTOR
* Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) which can then direct you to other journals our library may provide access to
* Consult with librarians - they are your friend. Bring them what you have found already and work with them to find further resources.
* Learn to use Google more effectively:
    * Search for phrases in quotation marks " " when appropriate
    * Try adding filetype:pdf to limit results to PDF files
    * You can limit searches to a particular domain or top-level domain, e.g. including: site:st-andrews.ac.uk or site:.edu

The long essays should use at least half a dozen sources which are not websites and the inclusion of at least one substantive primary source is required for a module such as this emphasising primary sources. This is not because there are not excellent websites with overviews on a topic, excellent wikipedia entries, etc. but because there is still usually far greater quality material found in published articles and books on most historical topics, including those which are assigned above. It is wise to make use of online research skills to get oriented in a new topic, but use this course as an opportunity to explore the wealth of academic research on your topics. Your essays will be assessed, in part, on how effectively your sources demonstrate your research efforts. Of course, digitized primary (archival sources, documents) or secondary sources (e.g. articles in academic databases) found in digital collection are permitted and an online source or two in addition to your other sources beyond the minimum is fine if chosen carefully for quality.

When you have found a good selection of a dozen or two sources through a process of skimming of footnotes and bibliographies etc., start your more detailed reading with something of broader coverage to give you some ideas of potential specific arguments or hypotheses. Then move swiftly and with more focus to search through the other sources in the specific sections that are likely to show whether your potential argument holds or not. In researching for an essay you rarely have to read an entire work, and even when you do so, you should skim less relevant sections. Unlike reading for pleasure, historical research involves reading as a hunt for answers to problems. If you find that your argument does not hold or has insufficient evidence to support it, zoom out again and restart the process.

This circular movement is one very effective approach to historical research. Start broad, find potential key arguments and inspiring ideas. Moving quickly, test these ideas and arguments by searching in other sources and zooming into detailed cases and examples. If this doesn't work or is insufficient, zoom out again and repeat. Once you are happy with an argument and the available evidence, then read more slowly and with determination, taking more detailed notes, and outlining your essay as you go.

**The Worst Possible Way to Proceed:** Perhaps the worst possible way to do research for your essay is to find a dozen or two works on your broad topic by title search. This usually results in you finding several very general and introductory works on your topic. Allow this collection of books and articles to rest comfortably on your shelf until the deadline nears, and then sit down and attempt to read all these works and hope that your essay will emerge from the vast knowledge you have gained in reading these books.

### Headers and Formatting

At the top of all your written work, please include:

* The date of submission
* The assignment you are submitting (e.g. Short Essay 1, Long Essay, etc.)
* Your student number
* A title, when appropriate
* The total number of words (use the word count feature of your word processor)

When formatting your assignments, please follow these guidelines:

* Add page numbers
* Use a minimum of 12 sized font
* Use a serif (such as Times Roman, Georgia, Garamond), not a sans serif font (such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)
* Please double space your essays

Other aspects of formatting are highlighted in the School of History style sheet. See the following section.

### Footnotes and References

Please carefully read the St Andrews School of History Style Sheet:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/stylesheet.html

This document, sections 1-4, contains extremely valuable information on how to compose your essay, including how to format your footnotes and bibliography. In particular, please follow the instructions for footnotes carefully.

### Online Submission

Unless otherwise indicated, work will considered submitted by the date the document was submitted online on the MMS. The digital submission is the only submission that matters for the mark. Paper copies of your long essays are requested and may be submitted in class or directly to my box on the first floor of St Katharine's Lodge.

### Extensions, Late Work, and Short/Long Work

Prior permissions for late submission of work ("Extensions") to make fair allowance for adverse circumstances affecting a student's ability to submit the work on time will be considered on a case by case basis. Normally such permissions will only be granted for circumstances that are both unforeseen and beyond the student's control. Please see the departmental guidelines for the penalties of late and short / long work:

http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/infoug/penalties%20for%20late%20work.html

### Feedback

General feedback is provided directly on the mark sheet, which will usually be posted to the MMS within 10 weekdays (2 weeks). Additional feedback, especially for longer essays is sometimes available on an annotated copy of your submitted work, usually return via MMS. Occasionally, feedback is written on a paper copy of the assigned work, which will usually be returned after the mark has already been posted to MMS.

### Two Assessed Presentations

Most weeks of the semester students will be given and opportunity to present a summary, critique, and raise some discussion questions based on supplementary readings. Two such presentations for each student will be given more time and assessed formally.

**Fall Presentation:** he assessed presentation should be 25-30 minutes in length and not longer. It may either focus on one or two books, or a collection of articles (3 articles to replace a book) from among the assigned required or supplementary readings for each week. It should summarise the main arguments, and make 1-3 to focused critiques or observations about the read material. A supplementary handout (1-2 pages at most) should be brought that includes some bullet points from the summary, any key persons or dates, and a few questions about the themes in the reading to kick off our discussion.

**Spring Presentation:** In the spring you will present for a slightly shorter time of 15-20 minutes and then, in effect, run the seminar for the remainder of the time up until the break (total 1.5 hours including presentation time). You may either present on one of the further reading books or "presentation opportunity" books, or alternatively, give an overview of one (if a book) or several (if articles) of the assigned readings - see instructions in the individual week entries. Either way, after you present you should pose questions to the class and guide the discussion seminar. You mark will be a combination of your presentation quality and the effectiveness of your leading the seminar (encouraging broad participation, following up on student responses, and quality of questions).

Important: You may be asked to make shorter presentations, 10 minutes or so in length throughout the year on some of the readings assigned. Volunteers will usually be asked and handouts are not required for these presentations. These shorter presentations are not assessed. When making these shorter presentations you should again bring a few questions for discussion. Some questions to consider as you prepare:

* Did the distributed handout of one or at most two pages accurately summarize the general points to be made in the presentation in the form of concise bullet points
* Did I upload the handout to MMS before giving my presentation?
* If appropriate, did the handout include any important dates, sources, or a map for the discussion?
* Did the handout include 1-3 discussion questions?
* Was the 20 minute limit strictly observed in the presentation?
* Was the presentation well structured, organized, and focus on a few key points?
* Was there a good balance of arguments and a few examples to support them?
