### Absence from Classes
Attendance is a basic assessment requirement for credit award, and failure to attend classes or meetings with academic staff may result in your losing the right to be assessed in that module. Please ensure that you are familiar with the 'Academic Alert' policy as stated elsewhere in this handbook.  If you have missed timetabled classes/events or any other compulsory elements of the module due to illness or an unavoidable pre-arranged event or appointment, you must complete a Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as possible.


### Absence from Examinations
Absence from Examinations due to illness or any other unavoidable reason should be reported by submitting a  Self Certificate of Absence form (through e-Vision) as soon as you are able to do so, preferably before the examination is due to take place and in any case no later than 24 hours after the examination.  You must contact the School responsible for the module being examined in order to request alternative arrangements, which are at the discretion of the School.   You are only required to notify the University Examinations Officer if there is a problem submitting the self-certificate.

### Illegible Exam Scripts 
It is your responsibility to ensure that your handwritten answers provided in examination scripts are legible and can be read by the markers. If a script cannot be read by the marker then this could result in a delay in confirming your module grade.  You may be charged for a transcription service and could be required to return to the School(s) concerned in order to transcribe the script.  If you have already left St Andrews then you will have to bear the costs of any return travel to the University.

### Academic Alerts 
Academic Alerts are a way of helping students who are having trouble coping with their studies, such as missing deadlines for handing in work, or missing compulsory tutorials. The aim of the Alert system is to help students by flagging up problems before they seriously affect students’ grades. Academic Alerts will be issued by email from the Director of Teaching, Director of Postgraduate Studies, Module Coordinator or School administrator and will tell students what is wrong and what they are required to do (e.g. attend classes in future).  The Alerts will also tell students what support the University can offer. If students do not take the action required they will get another Alert, and eventually will automatically get a grade of zero and will fail that module. The system is designed to help and support students in order to remedy any problems or issues before these lead to failing a module. Alerts will never appear on a student’s permanent transcript. For more information on Academic Alerts and details on how the categories work, see http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/Academic%20Alerts.pdf
