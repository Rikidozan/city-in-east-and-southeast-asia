## City Focus

We will be focusing on cities throughout the year but each semester each student should select a city to focus on. Students can decrease the amount of background reading they will need to do if the city they select is also the one, or similar to the one they focus in on for their long essay of the semester. However, it is also so that, each week, you spent 15-20 minutes looking briefly through your sources or online to think about how the week's themes are related to your city. Some of the larger cities have large bodies of published scholarship, but it may be more interesting to find a city that has some nice primary sources in a language you can read that you can progressively read into and draw upon during the year, since you will already be reading a lot of material on the largest cities. 

Build a basic chronology of your city along with a list of key people and interesting locations, links to maps from different periods, primary sources in languages you can read, and secondary scholarship related to your city. Upload this or add this to one already shared in our collaborative notes document. I may ask you to discuss issues from the perspective of your city in class. You may choose any city in East or Southeast Asia but you may wish to consider:

* Taipei (Taihoku)
* Shanghai
* Manila
* Kuala Lumpur
* Nanjing
* Mandalay
* Osaka
* Chengdu
* Nagasaki
* Bangkok (Thonburi, Rattanakosin)
* Pusan
* Yangon (Rangoon)
* Tianjin
* Wuhan
* Phnom Penh
* Harbin
* Qingdao
* Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)
* Mandalay
* Yokohama
* Chongqing
* Hanoi (Hà Nội, Bắc Thành, Thăng Long)
* Macao
* Jakarta (Batavia)
* Hangzhou
* Changchun
* Weihai (Weihaiwei)
* Xiamen (Amoy)
* Kyōto
* Suzhou
* Pyongyang
* Dalian (Dairen, Port Arthur)
* Guangzhou (Canton)
* Seoul (Hanyang, Hanseong, Keijō)
* Beijing (Beiping)
* Tokyō (Edo)
* Hong Kong
* Singapore

## Reading

Weekly average pages of required reading: 200-250 

This honours module is by no means an easy one. The fact that the module is on East Asian history, an area which students may have very little familiarity with, but not a sub-honours survey module, means that students should be prepared to take the initiative to read around the assigned materials and delve into the further reading in order to get a better understanding of the material. 

A work load of an average of 15-20 hours a week (some weeks you may need a few more, some weeks less) including the seminar is expected. Of this, you should expect your weekly preparation for eat class in terms of reading to be 7-12 hours in all weeks except the consolidation week and pair writing week, together with 3-6 hours of work on your assignments and research, especially for the long essay. I urge you to spread the load of your work on assignments across the weeks, to prevent stress towards the end of the semester. 

Your weekly reading will usually consist of up to 250 pages of required reading, plus some reading that you should select from the further reading, or other supplementary reading chosen by yourself to address content you may have trouble understanding or to boost your knowledge if it is related to your long essay research. Thus, working on an estimate of 250 pages a week total is a safe bet, or, at roughly 30 pages an hour (taking some limited notes), about 8.5 hours.

It is not possible to do your reading in a single sitting, as your concentration will fade, so I suggest you split the readings into two or three, and read them across several days. Give yourself more time for the primary sources vs the secondary sources relative to their length to allow you to pay especially close attention to language and detail in the former. I would recommend that you try to "timebox" the readings, giving yourself a fixed period of time for any given reading and, if it looks unlikely that you will have time to read something carefully, skim it with general notes on the main arguments, events, and issues, as necessary.  This is especially useful in weeks when you need to limit your reading preparation time in order to work more on your research for the long essay.

You may find the readings on short loan in the library or in some cases in scanned versions or in digital databases online. You can find our module list through the University Library:

## Module Website

We have a module blog at:

http://spatialhistory.net/cities/

Which will serve this modules across years. From time to time, I will ask permission of students to post selections from your gobbets, or offer you the opportunity to summarize and/or share a copy of your long essay, or summarize arguments from a presentation. This is not assessed, and you are not required to do this, but I have been extremely impressed by some of the work done in this module and would love to highlight it for past, present, and future students, as well as a wider readership beyond.
