## Moodle

We have a Moodle installation for the module. It can be found linked to from the MMS for our module. You can signup for your presentation week (or update it if you are switching with someone) on the Moodle. The moodle is where you post handouts for your elective reading and presentations (in addition to MMS for the latter).

## Reading

Weekly average pages of required reading: 180-250

This module, which has no final exam, is designed to provide you flexibility in your learning, while also providing themes that enable us to have rich seminar discussion. It is important that you come to tutorial well prepared as you will be expected to know the materials well. Your preparation for each week will require the usual 15-20 hours of work, and I suggest you **divide the preparation time across three days**:

1) Core readings that all students are required to read. (3-5 hours, except in weeks where there is no elective reading, in which case, more)
2) In most weeks required 'elective' reading that is selected by the student from several options provided. Choose one category of readings and be ready to introduce these elective readings to your fellow classmates. (4-7 hours)
3) Further reading in the general area of your long essay, specific research towards the long essay, or work on your blog entries and presentation preparation. (3-8 hours)

**Reading Handout**

Each week, you are required to upload a handout (1-2 pages) relating to the category of *elective readings* (unless there are no elective readings, in which case produce a handout on one of the regular required readings) you have done to the Moodle each week by the evening before class. *Note:* It is fine if your blog entries are written about the same text or texts that your chosen elective reading and handout are about. These handouts are not formally assessed but submission is required. If you have not submitted handouts throughout the semester you will receive an academic alert for not having submitted required work for the semester. Like the handouts for assessed presentations, it should give an overview of the main arguments, cases, sources, structure, and may include points of critique. If there are multiple texts in an elective reading category, then give the key arguments from each of the texts. **Note**: If there are both primary and secondary sources in an elective reading section, you need only include the secondary reading overview in your handout.

In submitting your handout you are showing your understanding of the main arguments and themes of the elective reading you chose. You may be called upon in class, without warning, to tell the class a bit about the category of elective readings that you read or elaborate on the details found in your handout. It is therefore important that you have your notes organised well enough to allow you to clearly and concisely present the main ideas beyond what you have in the handout. You may be also asked in class to report on the progress on your long essay research. Please be sure to researve some time each week to work on your long essay and be ready to say what progress you have made on it.

## Sleep

One of the most significant variables impacting your performance in this module is the amount of sleep you get. If you do not manage to get eight hours of sleep opportunity each night, there are serious consequences for your health. Your attention and cognitive ability will be impaired significantly. Your ability to problem-solve, think creatively, and form memories is measurably decreased both the following day, and in the days to come. This has been well-established in the scientific literature. Even obtaining 6 hours (an amount many people falsely believe to be sufficient) is universally harmful to your health and mental abilities. If you wish to learn more about the recent scientific studies on short- and long-term health consequences of anything less than an eight hour sleep opportunity, consider reading *Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams* by Matthew Walker (2017).
