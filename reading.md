## City Focus

Each semester, choose one of the cities of East or Southeast Asia to focus in on. Build a basic chronology of your city along with a list of key people and interesting locations, links to maps from different periods, primary sources in languages you can read, and secondary scholarship related to your city. Upload this or add this to one already shared in our collaborative notes document. I may ask you to discuss issues we cover from week to week from the perspective of your city in class. You may choose any city in East or Southeast Asia but you may wish to consider:

* Taipei (Taihoku)
* Shanghai
* Manila
* Kuala Lumpur
* Nanjing
* Mandalay
* Osaka
* Chengdu
* Nagasaki
* Bangkok (Thonburi, Rattanakosin)
* Pusan
* Yangon (Rangoon)
* Tianjin
* Wuhan
* Phnom Penh
* Harbin
* Qingdao
* Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)
* Mandalay
* Yokohama
* Chongqing
* Hanoi (Hà Nội, Bắc Thành, Thăng Long)
* Macao
* Jakarta (Batavia)
* Hangzhou
* Changchun
* Weihai (Weihaiwei)
* Xiamen (Amoy)
* Kyōto
* Suzhou
* Pyongyang
* Dalian (Dairen, Port Arthur)
* Guangzhou (Canton)
* Seoul (Hanyang, Hanseong, Keijō)
* Beijing (Beiping)
* Tokyō (Edo)
* Hong Kong
* Singapore

## Moodle

We have a Moodle installation for the module. It can be found linked to from the MMS for our module. You can signup for your presentation week (or update it if you are switching with someone) on the Moodle, and occasionally will be asked to post on a forum that is hosted there. It may also be used for other formative assessment tasks during the semester as needed. The most important use of this forum will be in the form of a research diary (required) and as a place for you to (optionally) share your prospectuses to get peer feedback. The research diary entries include a paragraph where you talk about what progress you have made in the research process, both successes and frustrations. You also update your topic, argument, and main sources that you are using there as the semester goes along. You also will be asked to post (required) a constructive comment on at least one other student posting.

## Reading

Weekly average pages of required reading: 180-250

This honours module is by no means an easy one. The fact that the module is on East Asian history, an area which students may have very little familiarity with, but not a sub-honours survey module, means that students should be prepared to take the initiative to read around the assigned materials and delve into the further reading in order to get a better understanding of the material.

A work load of fifteen to eighteen hours a week (some weeks you may need a few more, some weeks less) outside of seminar is expected. Of this, you should expect your weekly preparation for class in terms of reading to be 7-12 hours in all weeks except the consolidation week and pair writing week, together with 5-8 hours of work on your assignments and research, especially for the long essay. I urge you to spread the load of your work on assignments across the weeks, to prevent stress towards the end of the semester.

Your weekly reading will usually consist of 180-250 pages of required reading, plus some reading that you should select from the further reading, or other supplementary reading chosen by yourself to address content you may have trouble understanding or to boost your knowledge if it is related to your long essay research. Thus, working on an estimate of 250 pages a week total is a safe bet, or, at roughly 30 pages an hour (taking some limited notes), about 8.5 hours.

It is not wise to do your reading in a single sitting, as your concentration will fade, so I suggest you split the readings into two or three, and read them across several days. Give yourself more time for the primary sources vs the secondary sources relative to their length to allow you to pay especially close attention to language and detail in the former. I would recommend that you try to "timebox" the readings, giving yourself a fixed period of time for any given reading and, if it looks unlikely that you will have time to read something carefully, skim it with general notes on the main arguments, events, and issues, as necessary.  This is especially useful in weeks when you need to limit your reading preparation time in order to work more on your research for the long essay.

You may find the readings on short loan in the library or in some cases in scanned versions or in digital databases online.

## Sleep

One of the most significant variables impacting your performance in this module is the amount of sleep you get. If you do not manage to get eight hours of sleep opportunity each night, there are serious consequences for your health. Your attention and cognitive ability will be impaired significantly. Your ability to problem-solve, think creatively, and form memories is measurably decreased both the following day, and in the days to come. This has been well-established in the scientific literature. Cramming for examinations by reducing your sleep has been clearly shown to be counterproductive. Even obtaining 6 hours (an amount many people falsely believe to be sufficient) is universally harmful to your health and mental abilities. The short-term and long-term harm to your body and mind is compounded with multiple days of six hours of sleep (or even less). The permanent negative health consequences (life expectancy, mental health, chance of disease) of frequently getting less than a full night of sleep are also very well established. When missing out on sleep happens unavoidably, naps have been shown to significantly boost performance in mentally demanding tasks. There is unfortunately a widespread academic (and work) culture of pride in getting by sleeping less than eight hours, which I can only hope you will attempt to resist. If you wish to learn more about the recent scientific studies on short- and long-term health consequences of anything less than an eight hour sleep opportunity, consider reading *Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams* by Matthew Walker (2017).

## Module Website

We have a module blog at:

http://spatialhistory.net/cities/

Which will serve this modules across years. From time to time, I will ask permission of students to post selections from your gobbets, or offer you the opportunity to summarize and/or share a copy of your long essay, or summarize arguments from a presentation. This is not assessed, and you are not required to do this, but I have been extremely impressed by some of the work done in this module and would love to highlight it for past, present, and future students, as well as a wider readership beyond.
