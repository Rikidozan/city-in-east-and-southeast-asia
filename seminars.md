## Seminars

### Throughout Year

Consider getting a copy of:

Calvino, Italo *Invisible Cities* - It is a short but powerful work set as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Each chapter is no more than a few pages, and some are a single paragraph. Consider reading a chapter or two each week and reflecting on it.

### Week 9 - Long Essay Discussion and Pair Writing

**Preparation**

There is no assigned reading for this session. The time you would otherwise spend reading for our seminar should be dedicated entirely to work on your long essay. Take good advantage of this time.

Please bring your laptop or tablet to class for this session.

By this point in the semester, you should have made good progress on your long essay and composed at least some portion of it. This might be a first attempt at the introduction, an analytical passage articulating some important argument you wish to make, or an anecdote which provides a piece of support for your argument. It is tempting to have only a detailed outline at this point, but there is a very long way between the beautiful structure apparent on an outline and the reality of text on a screen. Please bring some portion of what you have written, no more than a single printed page in length with you. We will proceed as follows:

1. 30-45m - First we will exchange some of the written work we have done so far, read it silently for 10-15 minutes, and then have a discussion. Each student can discuss some of their challenges in the research so far, ask for help, and give each other general feedback.

2. 25m - We will form pairs and do a 'pair writing' exercise. During this time one student, the 'driver' will write on their long essay. This can be a direct continuation of what they have already written, a new section, or more casual free flowing of ideas about their paper. If you like, you can write a summary of your essay as a whole. If you are behind in your work, you can write an updated 'prospectus' discussing the direction you are hoping to develop the essay. As you do this, your partner, the 'observer' will sit beside you and watch you write, offering occasional feedback, suggestions, or pose questions to you about what you write. If you struggle with a phrase or an idea, your partner should offer you help. 

3. 25m - After a five minute break, we will switch driver/observer to allow the other partner to write. Same as above.

4. 30-45m - Finally we will re-form as a class and share thoughts on the experience and offer each other concrete suggestions on how to overcome problems faced so far, or where to proceed. Did you learn anything from the style or approach of your partner? Did you get any new ideas from interacting with others either in the groups early on or in the partner writing exercise? We will ask for volunteers, who are comfortable with their progress so far to present more in depth about their project and progress to everyone. Time permitting, we will share some of the material that we wrote together in class.
