## Seminars


### Week 0 - Urban History and Spatial History

You don't need to do any preparatory reading for our first meeting, which will only be one hour. Come with some thoughts about what "spatial history" might be, and what your understanding of space and place are. We will have introductions and then a discussion of some of these issues. We'll look over the structure of the module as a whole.

**Optional Background Reading**

If you have never taken a module on East or Southeast Asian History before, then these books can serve as useful references:

Tarling, Nicholas. *The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: Volume 3*. New Ed edition. Cambridge, UK New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2008.

Hwang, Kyung Moon. *A History of Korea*. 2nd ed. 2017 edition. Palgrave, 2016.

Gordon, Andrew. *A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present*. 3rd ed. edition. New York: Oxford University Press, USA, 2013.

http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/pdf/1978_Tokyo_as_an_Idea.pdf

**Task**

1. Using the Rumsey Map collection:

http://www.davidrumsey.com/

Find a map of a city in East or Southeast Asia from 1850-1950 that you find interesting. Print it out or bring it in on your laptop/tablet for us to look at and be prepared to discuss what you think we can learn about the city from it. You can create a printable version with the "Export" button visible when viewing a map in the website's viewer.

2. Choose a city to focus on for the semester from the list further up in the handbook. Poke around on JSTOR, Google Books, and the library to see if there are interesting articles and books on the city. Visit google maps and browse the city and street view (if available) for the city. Find its major landmarks and distinguishing features (major buildings, rivers, neighborhoods) and be ready to share your observations in class. Keep your notes on this for the task week 3. Note: The city focus doesn't have to be a city that you write about in your long essay and you can change your city in later weeks. 

### Week 2 - Historical and Theoretical Approaches to Urban Space

**Readings**

"Plan of the Present Work" in Henri Lefebvre *The Production of Space*, pp. 1-67.  
NOTE: Read this closely and carefully, and read through it again after you read the next two texts:

David Harvey "Space as a Keyword" and Sharon Zukin "David Harvey on Cities" in Noel Castree and Derek Gregory, *David Harvey: A Critical Reader* (Wiley, 2006), 102-120, 270-293.

"Space" in Andy Merrifield, *Henri Lefebvre: A Critical Introduction* (Taylor & Francis, 2006), 99-120.

"Walking the City" and "Spatial Stories" in Michel de Certeau, *The Practice of Everyday Life* (University of California Press, 2011).  
NOTE: Again, this is a challenging reading. In what ways is de Certeau compatible and incompatible with Lefebvre's approach?

Tuan, Yi-fu. *Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience*. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. Read Ch 2.

Massey, Doreen B. *For Space*. London; Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE, 2005. Read Ch 1-3 pp1-48.
NOTE: A third challenging reading. Please try to understand her critique of de Certeau, in particular.

**Task**

1. This week is a challenging on. Read all of the required readings, but bring to class a handout with organised notes on one of the following: Levebvre, de Certeau, or Massey. Be ready to answer questions about what certain difficult keywords mean, and what certain challenging sentences may have meant. As you read these theoretical texts, you may not find all of it useful or without contradiction but read with a sympathetic approach, asking yourself what might be helpful take aways from this that may come to help guide you as you read about cities in more concrete scholarship.

**Task**

1. Contribute to the shared SMPA document and be ready to present on one of your shared documents. 

### Winter Break

Over winter break, please read the following book:

Calvino, Italo *Invisible Cities* - It is a short but powerful work, available in cheap paperback, set as a conversation between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Each chapter is no more than a few pages, and some are a single paragraph. 

Also, please choose one of the following, read a bit on their background, and read some of their stories, available in cheap paperback:  
Eileen Chang (for example *Love in a Fallen City: And Other Stories* or *Lust, Caution: And Other Stories*)  
Edogawa Rampo (for example *Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination* or *The Edogawa Rampo Reader*)  

Take note of the ways in which urban environment and domestic spaces are described. How can literature help open up a world for historians in the studies of these?
